My dude, I would like to learn how to code a simple ruby app for writing poetry. It should say "welcome to the exquisite corpse app" when it opens. It should then ask the user for a working title. It then asks the user how many writers will be featured, and how many times round you will pass the app. Only accept numbers for the inputs. With these inputs, the app repeats the following pattern the number of times equal to the product of those two user input numbers: Allow a user to input up to 180 characters. Display that user's input. Allow a user to input up to 180 characters. Break 40 lines in the display. Display the new user input. After the pattern is over, write each line to a text file in order of user input, with a break between each input. Use the working title for a filename with the appropriate .txt appended.
