# surfing-corpse-poems
This is a simple app for writing exquisite corpse poems that I wrote with ChatGPT to test its capabilities for pseudocode interpretation.
Two versions of the app are in this directory. The surfcorpse-bot-version.rb file is the original code generated by ChatGPT. The surfcorpse.rb file is the human revision of ChatGPT's code.
